[Patent US5792012A](https://patents.google.com/patent/US5792012A/en)

[Green Biscuit](https://greenbiscuit.com/product/original-biscuit/) patent number written on their original green pucks: 
<br>
Filed in 1997; Expired in 2017

- three inches in diameter by one inch high (same as ice puck)
- improved performance by slightly increasing the diameter to 3.2 inches
    - and slightly reducing the height to 0.9 inches
- semi-tubular rivets are often the preferred rivet style for joints where movement is required (pivot points)
    - because the rivet material only swells at the tail.

#### Semi Tubular Rivets

Semi-tubular rivets (also known as tubular rivets) are essentially the same as solid rivets, but with a shallow hole at the tip, opposite the head. 

- This hole causes the tubular portion of the rivet (around the hole) to roll outward with force
- This reduces the amount of force needed for installation—tubular rivets require roughly ¼ the force of solid rivets.

## Thoughts

- Can I just use rivets with threads and put a bolt through?

- So then we can re-use half when half breaks
