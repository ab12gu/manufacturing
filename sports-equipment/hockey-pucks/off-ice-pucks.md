# Rivets

## Hockey Off-Ice Pucks

Patent: https://patents.google.com/patent/US5792012A/en

-  three inches in diameter by one inch high (same as ice puck)
-  Improved performance by slightly increasing the diameter to 3.2 inches
    - and slightly reducing the height to 0.9 inches
- tubular rivets require roughly Â¼ the force of solid rivets.
- Semi-tubular rivets are often the preferred rivet style for joints where movement is required (pivot points)
    - because the rivet material only swells at the tail.

## Thoughts

- Can I just use rivets with threads and put a bolt through?
