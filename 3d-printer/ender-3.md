## Software

Slicing software

- https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer
    - Most software for 3d printing is just a fork of this software (including bambu)
    - Build off of https://github.com/slic3r/Slic3r
    - Using prusaslicer for bambu will just have some features not included like flow optimization and vibration reduction, but still should work
- https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura
- https://github.com/CrealityOfficial/CrealityPrint (fork of cura)
